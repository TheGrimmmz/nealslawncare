      "title": "LAWN SERVICE",
      "description": "Lawn Service is done weekly throughout the season. Lawn mowing service includes lawn mowing, trimming, edging, and blowing. Grass areas in the front, back, and sides of your yard will be mowed in different directions in order to avoid ruts or damage to your lawn. Grass or weeds growing inside of beds will not be cut or tampered with in order to avoid damage to plant beds and our machines or employees. Trimming is done around beds, fences, and trees. Edging is done along sidewalks and driveways in the front and back yard. Neal's Lawn Care makes sure to blow clippings from sidewalks and driveways once the service has been completed."

        "title": "GATES AND PETS",
        "description": "We prefer that all your pets be kept indoors, and all gates unlocked on your mowing day. If you have a unique situation with a pet or gate please let us know, and we will accommodate you. EDU Lawn Service will not mow if pets are unsecured in a yard, front or back. Our crews are very careful about closing gates before they leave, but we do not guarantee that a pet will not escape from the yard, therefore, you accept our service with this provision. If we arrive to your property and cannot mow the back yard due to a pet in the yard or a locked gate, you will still be charged. Neal's Lawn Care is not responsible for lost or injured pets."

Large items such as lawn furniture and trampolines will be moved and mowed under, if requested."
